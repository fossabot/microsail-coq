abstract="The class of stencil programs involves repeatedly updating elements of arrays acc
ording to fixed patterns, referred to as stencils. Stencil problems are ubiquitous in scien
tific computing and are used as an ingredient to solve more involved problems. Their high r
egularity allows massive parallelization. Two important challenges in designing such algori
thms are cache efficiency and minimizing the number of communication steps between nodes. I
n this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework for a crucial aspect of formal verifica
tion of both sequential and distributed stencil algorithms, and we describe its Coq impleme
ntation. We present a domain-specific embedded programming language with support for automa
ting the most tedious steps of proofs that nested loops respect dependencies, applicable to
 sequential and distributed examples. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our library by
 proving the dependency-correctness of some real-world stencil algorithms, including a stat
e-of-the-art cache-oblivious sequential algorithm, as well as two optimized distributed ker
nels.",
